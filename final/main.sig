S,possibly_nonsurj_primes,"Given a quartic polynomial f, returns two lists. 1. The first is the list of primes of bad reduction for the Jacobian J of the curve C: y^3 = f(x). 2. The second contains four lists of primes. Put together, they contain all primes ell at which the mod-ell Galois representation associated to J, is strictly smaller than GL(3,F_ell) or GU(3,F_ell) over Q(zeta_3ell). The first of these lists is the list of small primes, i.e., primes upto 7. The second one captures primes at which the Galois image is possibly contained in the reducible type maximal subgroup. The third one corresponds to the field-extension type maximal subgroup and the fourth one corresponds to the imprimitive type maximal subgroup",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,312,,82,82,-38,-38,-38,-38
